# NBAGameGrid

Inspiration from ImmaculateGrid by Baseball Reference, NBAGameGrid is a trivia game where a random NBA game is fetched and users guess which players that played in that game filled up certain statlines. 

# Backlogs
  - Better UI/UX design
  - Dynamically change statlines each time the grid is reset everyday
  - Deploy the project
